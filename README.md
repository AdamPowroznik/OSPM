Author
----------
I created this app by myself - Adam Powroznik

Version
---------
The current version is `v2.1`. There still can be added new features to this application.

Why this app even exists?
---------------
I'm creating this kind of apps to upgrade my programming skills

and to make lifes of my friends from fire brigade easier in such tasks like fullfilling equvlent documents. 

Future features to add:

Bigger and right database - for now every data is storage in .XML files,
Another document automatically fill based on existing data,
Templates of another documents,
Some autostatistics module.

-----------
Some colors (styles) in calendar problems,
